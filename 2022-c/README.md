## Starting a new day

Quickly set up the files needed to write your code for a new day by running script:

Command:

```bash
./scripts/create_day.sh 7
```

Output:

```txt
> advent-of-code-2025-typescript@1.0.0 create:day
> ./scripts/create_day.sh 7

Created files in src/day07:
- example.txt
- input.txt
- problem.txt
- day07.c
```

To execute code for a given day, it first must be compiled to an executable file:

```sh
gcc day01.c -o day01
```

Then can be executed:

```sh
./day01
```
